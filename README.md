I used historical Olympics Dataset for this project. It can be found here.

This project focuses on answering following questions:

1) Which countries have had the most women representation over all the years of the Olympics?
2) How has the particpation by women over the years?
3) Do women contribute medals more during summer olympics or winter olympics?
